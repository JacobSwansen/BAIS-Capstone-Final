# BAIS-Capstone-Final
This project was for my capstone class for the business analytics major. I worked in a group of me and three other students for this semester long project. We worked with a company called College Raptor. They help high school students find the right college fit for them based off of many different features, both about the student and different universities. They also help admissions offices be able to recruit more efficiently and effectively. They gave us the heatmap they were currently using and wanted us to build upon and improve it. Tasked to create visualizations, we used both Power BI and Tableau. In Power BI, we used the drill down feature and the slider feature in order to create a more interactive and user specific visualization. This allowed the user to pick a specific aspect of a certain feature that best suits them or the university and evaluate how it effects the college choice. In tableau, we created more enhanced heatmaps that showed how certain locations effected certain features. It was also much more user friendly and easy to understand. Overall, we presented our final project to the sponsor and they approved, and ultimately implemented it into their own website.
